# CRUCIBLE
Building C ML algs from scratch until it feels trivial.

## RUNNING
Run project with

```sh
docker compose up
./run.sh sh 
```

You are now in the runtime. Run binaries 

## INPUT DATA
All input data should be in a jsonl format. Why? It's easy to read and trivial to parse. 

## MODELS
All models I've implemented thus far

### LINREG
